    <p>Although the origin of this beloved cookie is up for debate, there's no doubt it's a favorite during the holidays. Snickerdoodles are a type of drop cookie (any cookie that is formed by dropping spoonfuls of dough directly onto a baking sheet) that is coated in cinnamon and sugar. They can be crisp or soft, with a slightly cracked surface.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 ½ cups white sugar</li>
        <li>1 cup softened butter</li>
        <li>2 eggs</li>
        <li>2 ¾ cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons cream of tartar</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon baking soda</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon salt</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
        <strong><li>Step 1</li></strong>
        <p>Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper or lightly grease.</p>
        <strong><li>Step 2</li></strong>
        <p>Beat 1 1/2 cups white sugar, butter, and eggs together in a bowl using an electric mixer until smooth and creamy. Combine flour, cream of tartar, baking soda, and salt in a separate bowl; stir into creamed butter mixture until dough holds together.</p>
        <strong><li>Step 3</li></strong>
        <p>Mix 2 tablespoons white sugar and cinnamon together in a bowl.</p>
        <strong><li>Step 4</li></strong>
        <p>Form dough into 2-teaspoon-size balls and roll in the cinnamon-sugar mixture. Place dough balls, about 2 inches apart, on the prepared baking sheet.</p>
        <strong><li>Step 5</li></strong>
        <p>Bake in the preheated oven on the center rack for 7 minutes. Allow cookies to cool on the baking sheet for 5 minutes before transferring to a wire rack.</p>
